# üì± Roo-Code Mobile Remote Access

**‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING!** Control your Roo-Code VSCode extension from any mobile device or remote browser.

> **Status**: Fully functional as of 2025-01-10. Messages sent from mobile devices successfully start new Roo-Code tasks and trigger AI processing.

## üéØ What This Achieves

- **Remote Control**: Send commands to Roo-Code from your phone/tablet
- **Real-time Communication**: Messages appear instantly in VSCode
- **Cross-device Development**: Code from anywhere with just a browser
- **Simple Architecture**: Single-service approach eliminates port conflicts

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable IPC in VSCode Extension

**IMPORTANT**: The extension needs to be started with IPC enabled to receive remote messages.

```bash
# Option A: Start VSCode with IPC enabled (recommended)
./scripts/start-vscode-with-ipc.sh

# Option B: Set environment variable manually
export ROO_CODE_IPC_SOCKET_PATH="/tmp/app.roo-extension"
code .

# Option C: For development - Run Extension debug config with IPC
# The extension is now configured to automatically enable IPC in development mode
```

### 2. Start Remote Access

```bash
./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh
```

### 3. Stop Remote Access

```bash
./scripts/stop-roo-remote.sh
```

## üì± How to Use From Mobile

1. **Start the service** (on your computer):

    ```bash
    ./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh
    ```

2. **Find your mobile URL** (displayed by the script):

    - Usually: `http://[YOUR_IP]:8081`
    - Example: `http://192.168.0.106:8081`

3. **Open on your mobile device**:

    - Open any browser on your phone/tablet
    - Navigate to the URL from step 2
    - You'll see the Roo Remote UI interface

4. **Send commands**:
    - Type your message in the text area
    - Click "Send to Roo"
    - Message appears in your VSCode extension
    - Roo responds normally in VSCode

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Single Service**: POC Remote UI on port 8081
- **IPC Communication**: Direct connection to VSCode extension
- **No Dependencies**: No databases or complex infrastructure required
- **Zero Port Conflicts**: Eliminated competing services

### Service Status

- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8081/health`
- **Status Check**: `http://localhost:8081/status`
- **Log File**: `/tmp/roo-remote-ui.log`
- **PID File**: `/tmp/roo-remote-ui.pid`

### Network Access

The service binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8081`), making it accessible from:

- Local machine: `http://localhost:8081`
- Same network: `http://[COMPUTER_IP]:8081`
- Mobile devices on same WiFi network

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

```bash
# Check if anything is using port 8081
lsof -i :8081

# Force cleanup if needed
pkill -f "8081"

# Try starting again
./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh
```

### VSCode Extension Not Connected

1. **Most Common Issue**: VSCode wasn't started with IPC enabled

    ```bash
    # Restart VSCode with IPC enabled
    ./scripts/start-vscode-with-ipc.sh
    ```

2. Check connection status:

    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:8081/status | grep ipcConnected
    ```

3. Verify IPC socket exists:

    ```bash
    ls -la /tmp/app.roo-extension
    ```

4. If still not working, restart both services:

    ```bash
    # Stop remote UI
    ./scripts/stop-roo-remote.sh

    # Restart VSCode with IPC
    ./scripts/start-vscode-with-ipc.sh

    # Start remote UI
    ./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh
    ```

### Can't Access From Mobile

1. **Check firewall**: Ensure port 8081 is not blocked
2. **Verify network**: Mobile and computer must be on same network
3. **Find correct IP**: Run `ifconfig` to get your computer's IP address
4. **Test locally first**: Verify `http://localhost:8081` works

## üìä Service Management

### Manual Control

```bash
# Check if running
cat /tmp/roo-remote-ui.pid

# View logs
tail -f /tmp/roo-remote-ui.log

# Send test message
echo '{"message": "Test"}' | curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/send-message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-
```

### Automatic Restart

```bash
# Stop and restart in one command
./scripts/stop-roo-remote.sh && ./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria (All Achieved!)

- [x] **Port conflicts eliminated** - Single service approach
- [x] **Mobile access working** - Accessible from any device
- [x] **Real-time communication** - Messages flow to VSCode instantly
- [x] **Reliable startup/shutdown** - Bulletproof scripts
- [x] **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box
- [x] **Network detection** - Automatically finds mobile access URL
- [x] **Clean architecture** - No competing services

## üéâ What You've Achieved

You now have **fully functional remote access** to your Roo-Code extension:

1. **Mobile Development**: Control Roo-Code from your phone
2. **Remote Pair Programming**: Share access easily
3. **Multi-device Workflow**: Start coding on desktop, continue on mobile
4. **Simple Maintenance**: Single service to manage
5. **Reliable Operation**: No more port conflicts or startup issues

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Port (if needed)

Edit `poc-remote-ui/ccs/server.js`:

```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8081 // Change 8081 to desired port
```

### Security Considerations

- Service runs on local network only
- No authentication by default (local network access)
- For public access, consider adding authentication
- Firewall rules can restrict access

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs: `tail -f /tmp/roo-remote-ui.log`
2. Verify VSCode extension is running
3. Ensure network connectivity
4. Restart the service: `./scripts/stop-roo-remote.sh && ./scripts/start-roo-remote.sh`

---

**üéØ Mission Accomplished!** Your Roo-Code fork now provides reliable, simple remote access that actually works without chronic port conflicts.
