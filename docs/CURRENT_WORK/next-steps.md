**Estimated Time**: 4 hours ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Goal**: Understand existing React web interface structure

**Tasks**:

- [x] Review `web-ui/src/` components and structure
- [x] Identify existing communication patterns
- [x] Document current state management approach
- [x] Assess integration points for CCS connection

**Deliverable**: ✅ Architecture analysis complete - Phase 1.1 webview-ui integration working

## Immediate Actions (Next 8 Hours)

### 1. Phase 1.2: VSCode API Adapter Layer

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours  
**Goal**: Create WebSocket bridge for VSCode API compatibility

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create `src/adapters/VSCodeAPIAdapter.ts`
- [ ] Implement WebSocket client for React app
- [ ] Create message posting → WebSocket bridge
- [ ] Replace VSCode APIs with web equivalents (localStorage/sessionStorage)
- [ ] Update webview-ui imports to use adapter

**Deliverable**: Functional VSCode API compatibility layer

### 2. ✅ Design WebSocket Integration

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours ✅ **INFRASTRUCTURE READY**  
**Goal**: Plan connection between web-ui and CCS

**Tasks**:

- [x] Production CCS Server operational on port 3001
- [x] WebSocket infrastructure established
- [x] Message protocols documented in production-ccs
- [x] Connection management via existing CCS WebSocket server

**Deliverable**: ✅ WebSocket infrastructure ready for integration

### 3. Implement Basic WebSocket Connection

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours  
**Goal**: Establish real-time communication

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add WebSocket client to React app
- [ ] Implement connection lifecycle management
- [ ] Add basic message sending/receiving
- [ ] Test connection reliability

**Deliverable**: Working WebSocket communication

## Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Core Communication

- [ ] **Complete WebSocket integration** between web-ui and CCS
- [ ] **Implement authentication flow** in web client
- [ ] **Add real-time message streaming** for AI responses
- [ ] **Basic state synchronization** between extension and web client

### Week 2: Feature Implementation

- [ ] **Chat interface integration** - full conversation UI
- [ ] **Task management features** - start, monitor, cancel tasks
- [ ] **Settings synchronization** - sync extension settings
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness improvements**

## Medium-term Objectives (Next Month)

### Feature Parity Phase

1. **File Management Interface**

    - File browser component
    - File editing capabilities
    - Workspace navigation

2. **Advanced Chat Features**

    - Message history
    - Image attachments
    - Code formatting

3. **Extension Feature Integration**

    - MCP server management
    - Tool execution visualization
    - Progress tracking

4. **Multi-session Support**
    - Session management
    - Concurrent user handling
    - State isolation

### Performance & Security Phase

1. **Performance Optimization**

    - Message compression
    - Connection pooling
    - Caching strategies

2. **Security Hardening**

    - Input validation
    - Rate limiting
    - Session security

3. **Testing Implementation**
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests
    - End-to-end tests

## Technical Decisions Needed

### 1. State Management Strategy

**Decision Required**: How to sync state between extension and web client
**Options**:

- Event-driven updates
- Periodic full sync
- Hybrid approach
  **Timeline**: This week

### 2. Message Protocol Design

**Decision Required**: WebSocket message format and routing
**Options**:

- JSON-RPC style
- Custom message types
- REST-like over WebSocket
  **Timeline**: This week

### 3. Authentication Integration

**Decision Required**: How to integrate existing CCS auth with web client
**Options**:

- JWT in localStorage
- Session cookies
- Token refresh strategy
  **Timeline**: Next week

### 4. Mobile Interaction Patterns

**Decision Required**: How to optimize for mobile use
**Options**:

- Mobile-first design
- Responsive adaptation
- Separate mobile components
  **Timeline**: Week 2

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **WebSocket Reliability**: Plan fallback mechanisms and reconnection logic
2. **State Synchronization**: Design conflict resolution strategies
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize real-time communication
4. **Mobile Networks**: Handle poor connectivity gracefully

### Development Risks

1. **Integration Complexity**: Break into smaller, testable components
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Prioritize MVP features first
3. **Testing Gaps**: Implement testing alongside development
4. **Documentation Lag**: Update docs as we build

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Targets

- **Week 1**: WebSocket communication working
