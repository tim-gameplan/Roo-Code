# Remote Web Client Development Plan

## Overview

This document consolidates the current plan for developing a rich remote web client for Roo-Code that provides full functionality equivalent to the VSCode extension interface.

## Current Status

We have successfully demonstrated basic communication between a simple remote web client and Roo-Code, but the interface is very rudimentary. The goal is to evolve this into a rich web client that provides all the functionality of the current Roo-Code UI.

## Architecture

### Current Working System

```
Mobile Browser → POC Remote UI (Port 8081) → IPC → Roo Extension → VSCode Webview
```

### Target Rich System

```
Web Client → CCS (Central Communication Server) → WebSocket/IPC → Roo Extension → Rich Web Interface
```

## Key Components

### 1. POC Remote UI (Current - Basic)

- **Location**: `poc-remote-ui/`
- **Port**: 8081
- **Technology**: Simple HTML/Express server
- **Functionality**: Basic message sending via IPC
- **Status**: Working but rudimentary

### 2. Rich Web UI (Target)

- **Location**: `web-ui/` (React/Vite)
- **Port**: 5173
- **Technology**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Functionality**: Full Roo-Code interface
- **Status**: Partially developed, needs integration

### 3. Central Communication Server (CCS)

- **Location**: `production-ccs/`
- **Port**: 3001
- **Technology**: Express.js, WebSocket, PostgreSQL
- **Functionality**: Real-time communication, authentication, session management
- **Status**: Developed, needs testing

## Communication Protocols

### Current POC Protocol (Simple)

1. User types message in mobile browser
2. Form submission → Express server
3. IPC message → Roo extension
4. Extension injects message into VSCode webview

### Target Rich Protocol (Advanced)

1. User interacts with rich web interface
2. WebSocket messages → CCS
3. CCS routes to appropriate handlers
4. Real-time bidirectional communication
5. State synchronization across devices

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhance POC Communication

- Improve IPC reliability and error handling
- Add bidirectional communication
- Implement basic state synchronization
- Add authentication layer

### Phase 2: Rich Interface Integration

- Connect React web-ui to CCS
- Implement WebSocket communication
- Add real-time message streaming
- Sync UI state with extension

### Phase 3: Feature Parity

- Implement all VSCode panel features
- Add file browsing and management
- Include settings and configuration
- Add multi-session support

### Phase 4: Mobile Optimization

- Responsive design improvements
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Offline capability
- Performance optimization

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. State Synchronization

- Keep web client in sync with extension state
- Handle concurrent sessions
- Manage message ordering and delivery

### 2. Real-time Communication

- Implement WebSocket reliability
- Handle network interruptions
- Ensure message delivery guarantees

### 3. Authentication & Security

- Secure remote access
- Session management
- Input validation and sanitization

### 4. Performance

- Minimize latency for real-time feel
- Handle large message volumes
- Optimize for mobile networks

## Port Management

Current port allocation:

- **8081**: POC Remote UI (simple interface)
- **5173**: Web UI React (rich interface)
- **3001**: Production CCS (communication server)
- **Docker**: PostgreSQL database

## Success Criteria

### Technical

- [ ] Full feature parity with VSCode extension
- [ ] Real-time synchronization < 200ms latency
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface
- [ ] Multi-session support
- [ ] Secure authentication

### User Experience

- [ ] Intuitive mobile interaction
- [ ] Fast, responsive interface
- [ ] Reliable connectivity
- [ ] Seamless state management

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Analyze Current Web UI**: Review existing React web interface
2. **Design Integration Architecture**: Plan connection between web-ui and CCS
3. **Implement WebSocket Communication**: Replace simple HTTP with real-time WebSocket
4. **State Synchronization System**: Design bidirectional state sync
5. **Authentication Integration**: Connect web client to CCS auth system
