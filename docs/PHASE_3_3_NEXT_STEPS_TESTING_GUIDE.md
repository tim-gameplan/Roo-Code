# Phase 3.3 - Next Steps: Real-World Testing Guide

**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation Testing  
**Branch:** `first-run-testing`

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Now that Phase 3.2 has been completed with exceptional results, we need to move from automated testing to real-world implementation testing. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Roo-Code extension with actual remote access functionality.

## 🚀 TESTING SETUP REQUIREMENTS

### Prerequisites

1. **VSCode with Roo-Code Extension** - Development version from our fork
2. **CCS Server Running** - Production Cross-device Communication Server
3. **Multiple Devices** - For cross-device testing
4. **Network Access** - For remote communication testing

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP TESTING PROCESS

### Step 1: Start the CCS Server

First, ensure the production CCS server is running:

```bash
# Navigate to production CCS directory
cd production-ccs

# Start the server (should already be running from previous terminal)
pnpm run dev

# Verify server is running on http://localhost:3001
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
	"status": "healthy",
	"timestamp": "2025-07-01T22:07:00.000Z",
	"services": {
		"database": "connected",
		"websocket": "active",
		"redis": "connected"
	}
}
```

### Step 2: Install Development Extension

#### Option A: Development Extension (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the extension for testing
cd /Users/tim/gameplan/vibing/noo-code/Roo-Code
pnpm run build

# Package the extension
pnpm run package

# Install in VSCode
code --install-extension roo-cline-*.vsix
```

#### Option B: Development Mode

```bash
# Open the project in VSCode
code /Users/tim/gameplan/vibing/noo-code/Roo-Code

# Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
# This opens a new VSCode window with the extension loaded
```

### Step 3: Enable Remote Access in Roo-Code

1. **Open VSCode** with the Roo-Code extension installed
2. **Open Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
3. **Search for "Roo-Code"** or "Cline" commands
4. **Look for "Enable Remote Access"** or similar command
5. **Configure CCS Connection:**
    - Server URL: `http://localhost:3001`
    - Authentication: Use development credentials
    - Device Name: Set a unique identifier

### Step 4: Test Basic Connectivity

#### Test 1: Extension Activation

```bash
# Check if extension is active
# Look for Roo-Code/Cline icon in VSCode sidebar
# Verify extension appears in Extensions list
```

#### Test 2: CCS Connection

1. **Enable Remote Access** in the extension
2. **Check Connection Status** - should show "Connected"
3. **Verify in CCS Logs:**
    ```bash
    # Check CCS server logs for new connection
    cd production-ccs
    pnpm run dev
    # Look for WebSocket connection logs
    ```

#### Test 3: Device Registration

1. **Register Device** through extension interface
2. **Verify Device Appears** in CCS device registry
3. **Check Device Status** - should show "Online"

### Step 5: Cross-Device Communication Testing

#### Test 1: Multi-Device Setup

1. **Open Second VSCode Instance** (different device or user)
2. **Install Extension** on second device
3. **Connect to Same CCS Server**
4. **Verify Both Devices** appear in device list

#### Test 2: Message Synchronization

1. **Send Message** from Device A
2. **Verify Receipt** on Device B
3. **Test Bidirectional** communication
4. **Check Message Persistence** in database

#### Test 3: File Synchronization

1. **Open File** on Device A
2. **Make Changes** and save
3. **Verify Sync** appears on Device B
4. **Test Conflict Resolution** with simultaneous edits

### Step 6: Advanced Feature Testing

#### Test 1: Command Execution

1. **Execute Command** on Device A
2. **Verify Execution** appears on Device B
3. **Test Command Queue** with multiple commands
4. **Check Command History** persistence

#### Test 2: Workspace Synchronization

1. **Open Workspace** on Device A
2. **Verify Workspace** syncs to Device B
3. **Test File Tree** synchronization
4. **Check Workspace Settings** sync

#### Test 3: Real-time Collaboration

1. **Open Same File** on both devices
2. **Edit Simultaneously**
3. **Verify Real-time Updates**
4. **Test Conflict Resolution**

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues

#### Extension Not Loading

```bash
# Check VSCode logs
# Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console
# Look for extension loading errors
```

#### CCS Connection Failed

```bash
# Verify CCS server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check network connectivity
ping localhost

# Verify port 3001 is not blocked
netstat -an | grep 3001
```

#### WebSocket Connection Issues

```bash
# Check WebSocket endpoint
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" \
     -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: test" \
     -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
     http://localhost:3001/ws
```

#### Database Connection Problems

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL status
cd docker/development
docker-compose ps

# Restart database if needed
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Debug Mode

#### Enable Extension Debug Logging

1. **Open VSCode Settings**
2. **Search for "Roo-Code" or "Cline"**
3. **Enable Debug Mode**
4. **Set Log Level** to "Debug"
5. **Check Output Panel** for detailed logs

#### CCS Server Debug Mode

```bash
# Start CCS with debug logging
cd production-ccs
DEBUG=* pnpm run dev

# Or specific debug categories
DEBUG=websocket,database pnpm run dev
```
