# SYSTEM OPERATIONAL ROADMAP

**Date:** January 4, 2025  
**Status:** 🚨 **CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTORATION REQUIRED**  
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - System Integrity Compromised

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Roo-Code system has extensive feature implementation but critical operational failures. Port conflicts, service misconfigurations, and documentation drift have rendered key components non-functional. This roadmap provides a dependency-ordered plan to restore full operational capability.
