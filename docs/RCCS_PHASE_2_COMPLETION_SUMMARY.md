## Issues Identified

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Missing .env file** - Expected, non-blocking
2. **Punycode deprecation** - Node.js warning, non-critical
3. **One webview handler error** - Likely UI initialization, non-blocking

### No Critical Issues Found âœ…

## Next Phase Readiness

### âœ… Ready for Phase 3: Advanced Feature Testing

The system is now fully operational and ready for:

1. **Extension UI Testing** - Verify Cline/Roo-Code interface functionality
2. **Remote UI Testing** - Test cross-device communication features
3. **Production CCS Integration** - Connect with production server
4. **Advanced Feature Validation** - Test core extension capabilities

## Technical Achievements

### IPC Communication

- Successfully established Unix domain socket communication
- Client-server handshake completed
- Remote UI protocol operational

### Extension Integration

- Full VSCode extension activation
