## 🎯 Project Goals

The Remote UI Access feature transforms Roo from a single-device VS Code extension into a flexible, accessible development assistant that can be controlled from:

- **Web browsers** on any device
- **Mobile phones** and tablets
- **Secondary computers** without VS Code installation
- **Team collaboration** scenarios

### Key Benefits

✅ **Location Independence** - Work from anywhere, monitor from any device  
✅ **Device Flexibility** - Full functionality on phones, tablets, and web browsers  
✅ **Enhanced Workflow** - Monitor long-running tasks remotely  
✅ **Team Collaboration** - Multiple people can observe the same session  
✅ **Technology Agnostic** - No VS Code dependency for monitoring
