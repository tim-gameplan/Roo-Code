## üö® CRITICAL: TypeScript Compilation Error Resolution

### Overview

Resolve 224 TypeScript compilation errors preventing system testing and integration. These errors are expected integration issues from merging multiple development phases.

### Current Status

- **224 TypeScript compilation errors** across 23 files
- Issues stem from:
    - Missing type imports between services
    - Interface mismatches between components
    - Circular dependency resolution needed
    - Configuration inconsistencies
- **Blocking all testing and integration efforts**

### Context

Following completion of TASK-008.1.4.2 (Workflow-Schedule Integration), we have a fully implemented system with advanced orchestration capabilities. However, compilation errors prevent us from testing and validating the integrated system.

## üìã Tasks

### Task 1.1: Dependency Analysis & Mapping

- [ ] 1.1.1: Create dependency graph for all services
- [ ] 1.1.2: Identify circular dependencies
- [ ] 1.1.3: Map missing type imports
- [ ] 1.1.4: Document interface mismatches

### Task 1.2: Type System Alignment

- [ ] 1.2.1: Standardize interfaces across services
- [ ] 1.2.2: Fix generic type parameters
- [ ] 1.2.3: Resolve enum and union type conflicts
- [ ] 1.2.4: Update type definitions for consistency

### Task 1.3: Configuration Harmonization

- [ ] 1.3.1: Align tsconfig.json settings across projects
- [ ] 1.3.2: Resolve module resolution conflicts
- [ ] 1.3.3: Fix import path issues
- [ ] 1.3.4: Update package.json dependencies

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All services compile successfully
- [ ] Clean build process established
- [ ] Documentation updated with resolved dependencies

## üìÅ Files Affected

- `production-ccs/src/services/*`
- `production-ccs/src/types/*`
- `production-ccs/tsconfig.json`
- `production-ccs/package.json`

## üéØ Priority

**CRITICAL** - This issue blocks all subsequent testing and integration work.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Duration

3-5 days

## üìö Related Documentation

- [TASK-008.1.4.2 Completion Report](docs/TASK_008_1_4_2_FINAL_STATUS.md)

## üîó Dependencies

This is the foundational issue that must be resolved before any other integration testing can begin.

- `critical` - For blocking issues
- `high` - For important issues
- `medium` - For standard priority
- `low` - For nice-to-have items
- `phase-1` through `phase-5` - For phase tracking
