# Port Conflict Resolution - Completion Report

**Date**: January 4, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Execution Time**: ~30 minutes

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved all critical port conflicts identified in the comprehensive port allocation audit. The system now operates with accurate port assignments that match both documentation and reality, eliminating the confusion and service conflicts that were blocking development progress.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. âœ… Port 8081 Conflict Resolution

- **Problem**: POC Remote UI could not start due to Redis Commander Docker container occupying port 8081
- **Solution**: Relocated Redis Commander to port 8083
- **Result**: POC Remote UI now successfully running on port 8081

### 2. âœ… Port 3001 Production CCS Server

- **Problem**: Existing process blocking new Production CCS Server startup
- **Solution**: Terminated conflicting process (PID 93681) and started fresh instance
- **Result**: Production CCS Server now running successfully on port 3001 (PID 15025)

### 3. âœ… Redis Commander Relocation

- **Problem**: Documentation claimed port 8080 but actually running on 8081
- **Solution**: Moved to port 8083 with proper Docker container management
- **Result**: Redis Commander accessible at http://localhost:8083

```bash
docker run -d --name roo-code-redis-commander-dev -p 8083:8081 rediscommander/redis-commander:latest
Container ID: d4ccd7aac3e3e91726778e7de8d9e526714ff87224253b9ba5d80e37f1b44fe8
```

### POC Remote UI Verification

- Successfully running on designated port 8081
- No longer blocked by Redis Commander conflict
- Accessible for development and testing

## Documentation Updates Required

### 1. Port Registry Corrections

- âœ… Port 8081: Updated from "Redis Commander" to "POC Remote UI"
- âœ… Port 8083: Added new entry for "Redis Commander (Docker)"
- âœ… Port 3001: Confirmed as "Production CCS Server"

### 2. Service Access URLs

- Production CCS: http://localhost:3001
- Web UI: http://localhost:5173
- POC Remote UI: http://localhost:8081
- Redis Commander: http://localhost:8083

## System Integrity Verification

### âœ… All Critical Services Operational

1. **Production CCS Server**: Full functionality with database connections
2. **Web UI**: React development server running
3. **POC Remote UI**: Available for testing and development
4. **Redis Commander**: Database management interface accessible

### âœ… No Port Conflicts Detected

- Comprehensive port scan completed
- All services running on designated ports
- No blocking conflicts identified

### âœ… Documentation Accuracy Restored

- Port registry matches actual running services
- Service descriptions accurate and current
- Access URLs verified and functional

## Impact Assessment
