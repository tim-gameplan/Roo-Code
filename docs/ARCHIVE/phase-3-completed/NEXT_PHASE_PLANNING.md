## üéØ Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Sequential Implementation

Implement phases in logical dependency order:

1. **Database Integration** (5B) - Foundation for all other features
2. **Authentication & Security** (5A) - Essential for multi-user features
3. **Extension Communication** (5C) - Core functionality enhancement
4. **Real-time Collaboration** (5D) - Advanced user features
5. **Advanced Monitoring** (5E) - Production optimization

### Option 2: Parallel Development

Implement independent components simultaneously:

- **Track 1**: Database + Authentication (5B + 5A)
- **Track 2**: Extension Communication (5C)
- **Track 3**: Monitoring setup (5E)
- **Track 4**: Collaboration features (5D) - after Track 1 completion

### Option 3: MVP-First Approach

Focus on core functionality first:

1. **Extension Communication** (5C) - Core feature completion
2. **Basic Authentication** (5A subset) - Essential security
3. **Database Integration** (5B) - Data persistence
4. **Advanced features** (5D, 5E) - Enhancement phase

## üí¨ Discussion Points

### Priority Questions:

1. **Which phase should we prioritize first?**

    - What are the most critical features for your use case?
    - Are there specific user requirements driving priority?

2. **Implementation approach preference?**

    - Sequential vs. parallel development
    - MVP-first vs. comprehensive implementation

3. **Infrastructure readiness?**

    - Do you have PostgreSQL and Redis available?
    - What monitoring tools are preferred?

4. **Timeline considerations?**

    - Are there specific deadlines or milestones?
    - Resource availability for development?

5. **Feature scope preferences?**
    - Which features are must-have vs. nice-to-have?
    - Any specific requirements or constraints?
