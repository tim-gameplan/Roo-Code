- ✅ No blocking issues in core workflows

## Current System State

### Build Artifacts Ready

```
src/dist/
├── extension.js (33.2MB)
├── extension.js.map (17.3MB)
├── tiktoken_bg.wasm
├── tree-sitter-*.wasm (35 parsers)
└── workers/
```

### Server Status

- **Production CCS:** ✅ Running on development mode
- **POC CCS:** ✅ Running, ready for IPC connections
- **Expected IPC Errors:** Normal until extension activation

### Configuration Status

- **Launch Configuration:** ✅ Verified and ready
- **Debug Environment:** ✅ Configured for development
- **Source Maps:** ✅ Enabled for debugging

## Next Steps Protocol

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2.1)

1. **Launch Extension**

    ```
    VSCode Command Palette: Debug: Start Debugging
    OR
    F5 / "Run Extension" from Run and Debug panel
    ```

2. **Monitor Systems**

    - Watch Debug Console for extension errors
    - Monitor POC CCS terminal for IPC connection success
    - Verify Production CCS maintains stability

3. **Initial Validation**
    - Confirm extension appears in Extensions panel
    - Verify no critical errors in Debug Console
    - Check extension activation status

### Short-term Testing (Phase 2.2)

1. **Extension Functionality**

    - Command registration and accessibility
    - Webview component initialization
    - Basic UI rendering

2. **IPC Communication**

    - Socket connection establishment
    - Bidirectional message flow
    - Message routing validation

3. **Remote UI Features**
    - Webview UI loading and rendering
    - Basic remote control functionality
    - Cross-device communication capabilities

### Integration Validation (Phase 2.3)

1. **Server Communication**

    - Production CCS ↔ Extension communication
    - POC CCS ↔ Extension communication
    - Message persistence and routing

2. **Error Handling**
    - Connection recovery mechanisms
    - Graceful degradation testing
    - Error reporting validation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅

- Build system stability (proven in Phase 1)
- Server infrastructure (running and stable)
- VSCode configuration (verified and tested)

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️

- Node.js version mismatch (v23.4.0 vs expected 20.19.2)
- IPC socket permissions and path resolution
- Extension load performance with 33.2MB bundle

### Monitoring Points

- **Debug Console:** Extension errors and warnings
- **Production CCS Terminal:** Server logs and connection status
- **POC CCS Terminal:** IPC connection attempts
- **System Performance:** Memory and CPU usage during extension load

## Documentation Framework

### Completion Reports Required

1. **RCCS_EXTENSION_LAUNCH_REPORT.md** - Detailed launch results
2. **RCCS_IPC_VALIDATION_REPORT.md** - IPC connection testing
3. **RCCS_BASIC_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT.md** - Core feature validation
4. **RCCS_INTEGRATION_TESTING_REPORT.md** - Server-extension integration

### Progress Tracking

- **current-test-session.md** - Real-time progress updates
- **test-results-log.md** - Detailed test outcomes
- **known-issues.md** - Issue documentation and resolution

## Expected Timeline

### Phase 2.1: Extension Launch (10-15 minutes)

- Launch extension using debugger
- Verify basic loading and activation
- Confirm IPC connection establishment

### Phase 2.2: Basic Functionality (15-20 minutes)

- Test core extension features
- Validate webview UI components
- Verify command registration and execution

### Phase 2.3: Integration Testing (20-30 minutes)

- Test server-extension communication
- Validate remote control features
- Perform error handling tests

**Total Estimated Duration:** 45-65 minutes

## Success Indicators

### Extension Launch Success

- Extension loads in new VSCode window
- No critical errors in Debug Console
- Extension appears in Extensions panel
- IPC connection established with CCS servers

### Functional Validation Success

- Commands accessible via Command Palette
- Webview UI renders correctly
- Basic remote control operations work
- Server communication bidirectional

### Integration Success

- Stable server-extension communication
- Message routing functions correctly
- Error handling works as expected
- Performance within acceptable limits
