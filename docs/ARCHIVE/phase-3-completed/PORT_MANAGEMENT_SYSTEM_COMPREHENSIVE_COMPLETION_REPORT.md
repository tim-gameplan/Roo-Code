## System Validation Results

### Live Service Verification

```bash
# Production CCS Server (Port 3001)
✅ ACTIVE: node process listening on *:redwood-broker (3001)
✅ HEALTH CHECK: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-07-04T04:01:46.834Z"}

# Web UI React (Port 5173)
✅ ACTIVE: node process listening on localhost:5173
✅ CONNECTIONS: Multiple active browser connections established
✅ VITE DEV SERVER: Running successfully

# POC Remote UI (Port 8081)
✅ AVAILABLE: No conflicts detected, ready for activation
```

### Configuration Alignment

- ✅ **ROO_CODE_PORT_REGISTRY.md**: Official registry updated
- ✅ **PORT_ALLOCATION_AUDIT_AND_STANDARDIZATION.md**: Aligned with registry
- ✅ **Production CCS .env**: PORT=3001 configured
- ✅ **Web UI vite.config.ts**: Port 5173 configured
- ✅ **POC Remote UI**: Port 8081 configured

## Implemented Components

### 1. Official Port Registry

**File**: `docs/ROO_CODE_PORT_REGISTRY.md`

- Centralized port assignment documentation
- Service categorization (Production, Development, Testing)
- Clear ownership and purpose definitions
- Version control integration

### 2. Port Management Scripts

**Directory**: `scripts/port-management/`

#### Port Conflict Checker

**File**: `scripts/port-management/check-port-conflicts.sh`

- Automated port conflict detection
- Service status verification
- Conflict resolution recommendations

#### Port Manager

**File**: `scripts/port-management/port-manager.sh`

- Centralized port management utility
- Service start/stop coordination
- Port allocation automation

### 3. Application Startup Scripts

**Files**:

- `scripts/start-web-app.sh` - Coordinated web application startup
- `scripts/stop-web-app.sh` - Graceful service shutdown

### 4. Configuration Updates

- **Production CCS**: Environment variables standardized
- **Web UI**: Vite configuration optimized
- **POC Remote UI**: Port assignments verified
- **Docker Compose**: Port mappings aligned

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Conflict Resolution

- **Eliminated all port conflicts** between services
- **Standardized port ranges** by service type
- **Implemented conflict prevention** mechanisms

### ✅ Documentation Standardization

- **Created official port registry** as single source of truth
- **Updated all service documentation** with correct ports
- **Aligned audit documentation** with registry

### ✅ Automation Implementation

- **Port conflict detection scripts** for proactive monitoring
- **Automated startup coordination** between services
- **Graceful shutdown procedures** to prevent port locks

### ✅ Service Verification

- **Production CCS Server**: Verified running on port 3001
- **Web UI React**: Verified running on port 5173
- **POC Remote UI**: Verified configured for port 8081
