# Next Task Execution Plan - Testing Priority with Required Steps

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Branch:** `first-run-testing`  
**Phase Completed:** Phase 3.3 - Comprehensive System Integration Testing âœ…  
**System Status:** âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL** (95.8% test success rate)

---

## ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: FUNCTIONING SYSTEM TESTING

### TASK 1: LIVE SYSTEM VALIDATION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Objective:** Verify the system is functioning end-to-end for immediate testing

#### Step 1.1: System Health Check (5 minutes)

```bash
# Verify production CCS server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Test remote endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/remote/test_session_123

# Check WebSocket connectivity
node test-websocket-connection.js
```

**Expected Outcome:** All endpoints respond successfully with 200 status codes

#### Step 1.2: Extension Integration Test (10 minutes)

```bash
# Launch VSCode with the extension
code . --extensionDevelopmentPath=.

# Test extension activation and remote UI connection
# Follow: docs/PHASE_3_3_VSCODE_LAUNCH_GUIDE.md
```

**Expected Outcome:** Extension loads, connects to CCS server, and remote UI is accessible

## ðŸ“‹ REQUIRED TASKS SEQUENCE (NO SHORTCUTS)

### TASK 2: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Objective:** Prepare system for production deployment

#### Step 2.1: Environment Configuration (10 minutes)

```bash
# Copy production environment template
cp production-ccs/.env.example production-ccs/.env.production

# Verify production configuration
cat production-ccs/.env.production
```

**Expected Outcome:** Production environment file configured with proper settings

#### Step 2.2: Build Verification (10 minutes)

```bash
# Build production CCS server
cd production-ccs
npm run build

# Verify build artifacts
ls -la dist/
```

**Expected Outcome:** Clean build with no TypeScript errors, dist/ folder populated

#### Step 2.3: Production Server Test (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start production server
npm run start:prod

# Test production endpoints
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3001/remote/test_session_123
```

**Expected Outcome:** Production server runs successfully, all endpoints functional

### TASK 3: WEB INTERFACE TESTING

**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Objective:** Validate web interface functionality

#### Step 3.1: Web UI Launch (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start web interface
cd web-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Expected Outcome:** Web UI launches on localhost:5173, no build errors

#### Step 3.2: Web UI Integration Test (10 minutes)

```bash
# Test web UI connection to CCS server
# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# Test login and chat functionality
```

**Expected Outcome:** Web UI connects to CCS server, authentication works, chat interface functional

### TASK 4: COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TEST

**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Objective:** End-to-end system validation

#### Step 4.1: Multi-Component Test (15 minutes)

1. **VSCode Extension** running and connected
2. **Production CCS Server** operational on localhost:3001
3. **Web UI** running on localhost:5173
4. **Cross-component communication** verified

**Test Scenario:**

- Send message from VSCode extension
- Verify message appears in web UI
- Send response from web UI
- Verify response appears in VSCode extension

**Expected Outcome:** Bidirectional communication works across all components

#### Step 4.2: Performance Validation (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run performance test
node docs/testing/phase-3-3-2/production-load-performance-test-automation.js
```

**Expected Outcome:** Performance metrics meet targets (response time <2s, memory <500MB)

---

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Task 1 Fails:

1. Check if CCS server is running: `ps aux | grep node`
2. Restart CCS server: `cd production-ccs && npm start`
3. Check port conflicts: `lsof -i :3001`

### If Task 2 Fails:

1. Check TypeScript compilation: `cd production-ccs && npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Verify dependencies: `npm install`
3. Check environment variables: `cat .env`

### If Task 3 Fails:

1. Check web UI dependencies: `cd web-ui && npm install`
2. Verify Vite configuration: `cat vite.config.ts`
3. Check port conflicts: `lsof -i :5173`

### If Task 4 Fails:

1. Check all component logs for errors
2. Verify network connectivity between components
3. Test individual components in isolation
