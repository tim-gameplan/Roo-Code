## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Switch to Testing Branch**

    ```bash
    git checkout first-run-testing
    ```

2. **Run Automated Setup**

    ```bash
    ./scripts/test-automation/start-testing.sh
    ```

3. **Review Test Plan**

    - Open `docs/RCCS_FIRST_RUN_TEST_PLAN.md`
    - Familiarize yourself with the 4-phase approach

4. **Start Testing Session**

    - Update `docs/testing/current-test-session.md` with your details
    - Begin with Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation

5. **Track Progress**
    - Update test results in `docs/testing/test-results-log.md`
    - Document any issues using the GitHub issue template

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or the automation script encounters issues:

1. **Start Docker Services**

    ```bash
    cd docker/development
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Setup Production CCS**

    ```bash
    cd production-ccs
    pnpm install
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    pnpm run migrate
    ```

3. **Verify Setup**

    ```bash
    # Test database connection
    docker exec rccs-postgres pg_isready -U rccs_user -d rccs_dev

    # Test Redis connection
    docker exec rccs-redis redis-cli ping

    # Start CCS server
    cd production-ccs
    pnpm run dev
    ```
