# ðŸ”’ Fork Workflow Safety Guide

## ðŸ“‹ **OVERVIEW**

This guide ensures **100% safe development** within your fork (`tim-gameplan/Roo-Code`) with zero risk to the upstream repository. All workflows are designed to keep development contained within your fork.

## âœ… **FORK SAFETY VERIFICATION**

### **Current Setup Confirmed**

- **Repository**: `tim-gameplan/Roo-Code` (your fork) âœ…
- **Remote Origin**: Points to your fork âœ…
- **Branch**: `feature/phase-4-advanced-orchestration` âœ…
- **Upstream Risk**: **ZERO** - No upstream repository access âœ…

### **Safe Development Environment**

- **Complete Control**: Full control over development process
- **Team Collaboration**: Internal collaboration within your fork
- **Safe Experimentation**: Freedom to develop without external impact
- **No Upstream Interference**: Zero possibility of affecting upstream repository

## ðŸ”§ **FORK WORKFLOW COMMANDS**

### **Git Remote Verification**

```bash
# Verify current remote setup
git remote -v

# Expected output (your fork only):
# origin  https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code.git (push)
```

### **Branch Management**

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch -a

# Create new feature branch (if needed)
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Switch between branches
git checkout main
git checkout feature/phase-4-advanced-orchestration
```

### **Safe Development Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Commit changes
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# 4. Push to your fork (safe)
git push origin feature/phase-4-advanced-orchestration

# 5. Create pull request within your fork
# Visit: https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code/compare
```

## ðŸš€ **GITHUB OPERATIONS (FORK-SAFE)**

### **Pull Request Creation**

- **Source**: Your fork (`tim-gameplan/Roo-Code`)
- **Target**: Your fork's main branch (`tim-gameplan/Roo-Code:main`)
- **URL**: `https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code/compare/main...feature/phase-4-advanced-orchestration`
- **Safety**: 100% contained within your fork

### **Issue Management**

- **Repository**: `tim-gameplan/Roo-Code` (your fork)
- **URL**: `https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code/issues`
- **Safety**: All issues within your fork's issue tracker

### **Team Collaboration**

- **Collaborators**: Add team members to your fork
- **Reviews**: Team members can review within your fork
- **Discussions**: All discussions within your fork's environment

## ðŸ”’ **SAFETY GUARANTEES**

### **No Upstream Risk**

- **Repository Isolation**: Your fork is completely isolated
- **No Upstream Access**: Zero possibility of affecting upstream repository
- **Safe Experimentation**: Complete freedom to develop and test
- **Team Control**: Full control over who has access

### **Development Freedom**

- **Branch Creation**: Create unlimited branches within your fork
- **Experimental Features**: Test new features without risk
- **Code Reviews**: Internal team reviews within your fork
- **Deployment Testing**: Safe testing environment

## ðŸ“Š **WORKFLOW VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **Before Starting Development**

- [ ] **Remote Verification**: Confirm `git remote -v` shows only your fork
- [ ] **Branch Check**: Verify you're on the correct feature branch
- [ ] **Fork Isolation**: Confirm no upstream remote configured
- [ ] **Team Access**: Ensure team members have access to your fork

### **During Development**

- [ ] **Commit Locally**: All commits go to your fork
- [ ] **Push to Fork**: All pushes target your fork's branches
- [ ] **PR Creation**: Pull requests created within your fork
- [ ] **Issue Tracking**: All issues tracked in your fork

### **Before Team Collaboration**

- [ ] **Fork Access**: Team members added as collaborators
- [ ] **Branch Sharing**: Feature branches pushed to your fork
- [ ] **Documentation**: All guides reference your fork URLs
- [ ] **Review Process**: Code reviews within your fork environment

## ðŸŽ¯ **COMMON OPERATIONS (FORK-SAFE)**

### **Creating a New Feature**

```bash
# 1. Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# 3. Develop your feature
# ... make changes ...

# 4. Commit and push to your fork
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name

# 5. Create PR in your fork
# Visit: https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code/compare
```

### **Updating from Main**

```bash
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes from your fork
git pull origin main

# 3. Switch back to feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Merge or rebase with main
git merge main
# OR
git rebase main
```

### **Team Collaboration**

```bash
# 1. Team member clones your fork
git clone https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code.git

# 2. Team member creates feature branch
git checkout -b feature/team-member-feature

# 3. Team member pushes to your fork
git push origin feature/team-member-feature

# 4. Create PR within your fork for review
```

## ðŸ“‹ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Upstream Remote Exists**

```bash
# Check for upstream remote
git remote -v

# If upstream exists, remove it for safety
git remote remove upstream

# Verify only origin (your fork) remains
git remote -v
```

### **If Wrong Repository**

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote get-url origin

# If not your fork, update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/tim-gameplan/Roo-Code.git

# Verify the change
git remote -v
```

### **Branch Confusion**

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout feature/phase-4-advanced-orchestration

# Verify current branch
git branch --show-current
```
