## 4. GitHub Projects Setup

### 4.1 Project Board Configuration

Create a GitHub Project with the following structure:

#### Columns

1. **📋 Backlog** - All planned work
2. **🔍 Ready** - Issues ready to start
3. **🚧 In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **👀 Review** - Waiting for code/documentation review
5. **🧪 Testing** - Ready for QA testing
6. **✅ Done** - Completed work

#### Views

1. **By Phase** - Group issues by development phase
2. **By Component** - Group issues by system component
3. **By Assignee** - Group issues by team member
4. **Priority View** - Sort by priority labels

### 4.2 Automation Rules

Set up GitHub Actions automation:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/project-automation.yml
name: Project Automation

on:
    issues:
        types: [opened, closed, labeled]
    pull_request:
        types: [opened, closed, ready_for_review]

jobs:
    update_project:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Move new issues to Backlog
              if: github.event.action == 'opened'
              uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.1
              with:
                  project: Feature 2 Remote UI
                  column: Backlog
                  repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

            - name: Move in-progress issues
              if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'status/in-progress')
              uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.1
              with:
                  project: Feature 2 Remote UI
                  column: In Progress
                  repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 5. Milestone Planning

### 5.1 Milestone Structure

Create GitHub Milestones aligned with implementation phases:

#### Milestone 1: Core Backend Infrastructure

- **Due Date**: 6 weeks from start
- **Description**: Complete CCS development and basic IPC communication
- **Issues**: All Phase 1 tasks from implementation plan

#### Milestone 2: Basic UI Interaction

- **Due Date**: 10 weeks from start
- **Description**: Working end-to-end remote UI functionality
- **Issues**: All Phase 2 tasks from implementation plan

#### Milestone 3: Feature Enrichment

- **Due Date**: 14 weeks from start
- **Description**: Mobile optimization and advanced features
- **Issues**: All Phase 3 tasks from implementation plan

#### Milestone 4: Production Ready

- **Due Date**: 15 weeks from start
- **Description**: Testing complete, documentation finalized
- **Issues**: All Phase 4 tasks from implementation plan

### 5.2 Milestone Tracking

Use GitHub's milestone progress tracking to monitor:

- Percentage of issues completed
- Open vs. closed issues
- Milestone burn-down charts
- Timeline adherence

---

## 6. Documentation Tracking

### 6.1 Documentation Status Tracking

Create a GitHub Issue for each documentation section:

```markdown
# Documentation Tracking Issues

## Core Documents

- [ ] #001 Project Objectives - Complete
- [ ] #002 Feature 2 SRS - Draft → Review → Final
- [ ] #003 API Specifications - Draft → Review → Final
- [ ] #004 Implementation Plan - Draft → Review → Final
- [ ] #005 System Architecture - Draft → Review → Final

## Supporting Documents

- [ ] #006 GitHub Project Management - Draft
- [ ] #007 User Documentation - Not Started
- [ ] #008 Developer Setup Guide - Not Started
- [ ] #009 Deployment Guide - Not Started
```

### 6.2 Documentation Review Process

1. **Draft Status** - Initial version created
2. **Review Status** - Under stakeholder review
3. **Revision Status** - Incorporating feedback
4. **Final Status** - Approved and locked

Use GitHub's review features:

- Pull requests for documentation changes
- Required reviewers for documentation PRs
- Branch protection rules for docs folder

### 6.3 Documentation Versioning

Track documentation versions using:

- Git tags for major documentation releases
- Semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
- Changelog tracking in each document

---

## 7. Issue Creation from Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Automated Issue Creation

Create issues directly from the implementation plan tasks:

#### Phase 1 Issues

```bash
# Example GitHub CLI commands to create issues

gh issue create \
  --title "[CCS] Project Setup and Foundation" \
  --body "Implementation of A1.1 from implementation plan" \
  --label "type/feature,component/ccs,phase/1-backend,priority/high" \
  --milestone "Core Backend Infrastructure"

gh issue create \
  --title "[CCS] Authentication System" \
  --body "Implementation of A1.2 from implementation plan" \
  --label "type/feature,component/ccs,phase/1-backend,priority/high" \
  --milestone "Core Backend Infrastructure"
```

### 7.2 Task Breakdown Structure

Each implementation plan task becomes:

1. **Epic Issue** - High-level task (e.g., "Authentication System")
2. **Story Issues** - Specific deliverables within the task
3. **Sub-task Issues** - Individual development items

Example hierarchy:

```
Epic: #010 Authentication System
├── Story: #011 JWT Token Implementation
│   ├── Task: #012 Token generation
│   ├── Task: #013 Token validation
│   └── Task: #014 Token refresh
├── Story: #015 User Registration
└── Story: #016 Session Management
```

## 8. Progress Tracking and Reporting

### 8.1 Weekly Progress Reports

Automate weekly progress reports using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/weekly-report.yml
name: Weekly Progress Report

on:
    schedule:
        - cron: "0 9 * * MON" # Every Monday at 9 AM

jobs:
    generate_report:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Generate Progress Report
              uses: actions/github-script@v6
              with:
                  script: |
                      // Generate report from issues and milestones
                      // Post to team Slack/Discord channel
```

### 8.2 Dashboard Metrics

Track key metrics:

- **Velocity**: Issues completed per week
- **Burn-down**: Progress toward milestones
- **Quality**: Bug rate and resolution time
- **Documentation**: Coverage and freshness

### 8.3 Stakeholder Updates

Regular updates to stakeholders:

- **Daily**: Automated progress in team channels
- **Weekly**: Milestone progress reports
